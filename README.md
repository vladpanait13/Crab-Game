# Crab-Game
Created a retro game where you are a crab and you have to jump over obstacles

I've created a simple 8-bit style crab using SVG. Here's a breakdown of the design:

- The crab's body is a rectangular shape in orange-red (#FF4500).
- It has two square black eyes.
- There are two claws, one on each side.
- The crab has three legs visible at the bottom.

This design uses basic geometric shapes to create a pixelated look, which is characteristic of 8-bit graphics. The crab is facing forward, which is a common perspective in retro games.
You can easily modify this SVG by changing the colors or adjusting the sizes and positions of the rectangles. For example, you could make the crab a different color by changing the fill color of the body, claws, and legs.

I've created a simple side-scrolling game featuring the crab character we designed earlier. Here's a breakdown of the game:

The game uses an HTML5 canvas for rendering.
The crab character is drawn using simple rectangles, mimicking our 8-bit design.
The crab can jump using the spacebar.
Obstacles (green rectangles) appear from the right side of the screen.
The player's score increases as they successfully avoid obstacles.
If the crab collides with an obstacle, the game ends and resets.

To play the game:

- The crab character is always on the left side of the screen.
- Press the spacebar to make the crab jump and avoid obstacles.
- Try to survive as long as possible and achieve a high score.

This game provides a basic framework that you can easily expand upon. Here are some ideas for enhancements that were done for v2:

Added different types of obstacles and power-ups.
Implemented varying difficulty levels as the score increases.
Added sound effects and background music.
Created more detailed graphics or animations for the crab and obstacles.
Implemented a high score system using local storage.
